Implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), discovered by Don Coppersmith in his June 1994 paper titled "An Approximate Fourier Transform Useful in Quantum Factoring” is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing. It serves as a quantum analog of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), performing a similar mathematical operation but on qubits instead of classical data. While DFT converts a sequence of complex numbers from the time domain to the frequency domain, QFT transforms quantum states into phase-encoded superpositions, enabling powerful computational capabilities through quantum parallelism, such as in quantum phase estimation where it is used for precision measurements in quantum chemistry and material science. QFT plays a pivotal role in Shor’s Algorithm, where it is used for period finding, a crucial step in the integer factorization process (Wikipedia contributors, 2025). By efficiently identifying the periodicity of functions related to modular exponentiation, the QFT enables Shor’s Algorithm to factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms, posing a significant challenge to traditional cryptographic systems like Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), a widely used encryption algorithm that secures data by relying on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
